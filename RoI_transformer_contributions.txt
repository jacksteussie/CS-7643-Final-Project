The RoI transformer described in the document was created using the OBBDetection repository which can be found here https://github.com/jbwang1997/OBBDetection/tree/master.

I apologize as it may be difficult to see what exactly was created to work with this model.

I created the following files in the OBBDetection directory for the proper execution of the model on the DOTA 1.5 dataset:
configs/obb/roi_transformer/faster_rcnn_roitrans_r50_fpn_1x_dota15_custom.py
configs/obb/roi_transformer/faster_rcnn_roitrans_r50_fpn_1x_dota15_custom_dist.py
configs/obb/_base_/datasets/custom_dota.py
configs/obb/_base_/schedules/schedule_1x_custom.py
configs/obb/_base_/schedules/schedule_1x_custom_dist.py
BboxToolkit/tools/split_configs/dota1_5/custom_ss_dota_train.json
BboxToolkit/tools/split_configs/dota1_5/custom_ss_dota_val.json
BboxToolkit/tools/split_configs/dota1_5/custom_ss_dota_train_realtime.json


In addition to these files, I made amendments to several files in the repository to address package versioning issues.
